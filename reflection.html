       <h3>• Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?</h3>

       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive design is a web development method that can automatically adjust its content and elements according to the screen size of the user's smart device.
          For example, when a user switches from a computer to a mobile phone to log in to the website,
          the website will automatically adjust the screen size of the user's mobile phone to adjust the content and do not
          require the user to make additional operations such as sliding the screen to view the content, which greatly improves
          the user's browsing experience when visiting the website.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Responsive design is a very important development method for web design. In addition to improving the user experience,
          it can also make the website easier to manage and reduce the maintenance cost of the website.</p>


       <br />
       <h3>• How does responsive design relate to web technologies?</h3>

       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With the development of the times, web technology is changing with each passing day,
           and has been gradually used in various smart devices. This development has brought us convenience but also brought
           some problems. Generally speaking, web technology relies on CSS to determine various elements of the appearance of a web page,
           and as web technology is applied to more and more devices, how to adapt the same HTML to all devices has become a problem that needs to be solved urgently. At this time,
           the emergence of responsive design has solved this problem. In responsive design, page elements will be rearranged as the viewport grows or shrinks,
           which makes web technology applicable to various smart devices</p>


        <br />
        <h3>• What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research?</h3>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When building web applications for different devices, I learned and used 'viewport' to adapt to the screens of different devices.
           The viewport is the user visible area of ​​the web page, and in responsive design, we can use the viewport to adapt to the respective device’s screen size.
           Generally speaking, we can include viewport elements in 'meta' element. Example:&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/&gt;,
           width=device -width means to automatically adjust the screen and page width according to the device,
           and initial-scale=1.0 sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this web, I fixed the width of the desktop screen and set it to 1100px  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=1100, initial-scale=1.0"/&gt;</p>


        <br />
        <h3>• learning experience</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first came into contact with the web, I fell in love with it. It is not as troublesome as C++, but it makes me feel very interesting.
            Through the study of this semester, I have probably learned about web technology and have benefited a lot from the creation of JS and CSS.
            I look forward to studying next semester! </p>
